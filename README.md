# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, and textpos for the aside.

To compile, please run `build`. To recompile, please run `build clean` first.

XeLaTeX is required.
